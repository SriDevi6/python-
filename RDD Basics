RDD-Resilient  Distributed  Dataset. 
Suppose we perform multiple operations on a RDD, 
All the RDDS will be created only if you perform an action on the RDD.
It will simple create a DAG in its memory , DAG (execution plan) would be ready, only when an action is called then only RDDS are created and the eexcution plan is executed.

Persist an RDD.
  I want an RDD and I use it again and again.
  Then I can persist the RDD in memory
  def: saving the RDD in memory so that RDDs are not computed again and again.
